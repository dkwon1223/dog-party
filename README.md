# Dog Party Static Comp

## Abstract/Background
A solo project in which I attempted to replicate the web page design found [here](dog-party-spec.png). The design was not meant to be responsive; instead the objective was a simple practice project in order to enhance my skills with CSS styling and refactoring by implementing variables and mixins using SCSS and Webpack to replicate the design as closely as possible.
